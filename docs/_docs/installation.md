## System Requirements
1. Windows 10/11, Linux or Mac.
2. An NVIDIA graphics card, preferably with 4GB or more of VRAM or an M1 or M2 Mac. But if you don't have a compatible graphics card, you can still use it with a "[Use CPU](/docs/settings/#system-settings)" setting. It'll be very slow, but it should still work.
3. 8GB of RAM and 20GB of disk space.

You do not need anything else. You do not need WSL, Docker or Conda. The installer will take care of it. yayayyaya
